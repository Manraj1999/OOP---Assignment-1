<------ Be prepared for extreme nuke launch codes ------>

This is the first assignment for our (Aliah and Manraj) Object-Oriented Programming subject.
The reason why the source code is up on GitHub is...idk why tbh...but it's here yay!
Do whatever you want with it, I don't really mind anyone using it but please don't use it for your assignments and say it's yours hahaha
If you ever do that, I'll come to your house and take your laptop away.
Am I drunk? No, I don't think so. I'm pretty sure I'm sober.
This is line 8.
Yep, I'm sober.
Why are you even still reading this?
Shouldn't you be looking at the source code?
I wouldn't really blame you if you're reading this.
Writing code can really exhaust your mind sometimes.
I should go now.
I believe this is farewell for now.
I'll see you soon, stranger.
Goodbye.
